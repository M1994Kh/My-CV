    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I'm a Python developer. After achieving several certifications in Python programming, 
        I've found my favorite field of work. Data analytics is my enthusiasm, and I'm currently 
        working self-employed on mining financial data from different sources, doing experiments 
        on datasets, and visualizing them in various methods to find the best models for using them. 
        It is just the beginning, and I'm eager to learn more to enhance my abilities and expand my knowledge.
        Projects that I am currently working on them:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Collecting datasets of property prices in suburban lands of cities and studying their changes during the last years to find the best place with jumping prices for short time investment.</li>
        <li>Studying Trade Map website raw data and testing different processes to find signaling parameters for identifying the potential of export and supply commodities for various destinations.</li>
    </ol>

        <p>Any suggestions on cooperation and teamwork on new ideas would be precious to me, and I'll appreciate it.</p>
